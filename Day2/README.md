## Todays's Assignment:

# "Drumline!"

Yesterday's project had a focal point on the styles.css file and CSS In General, Today we'll focus on the JAVASCRIPT. Javascript is the brains of a webpage, its what we use to "make things happen".
With that being said, Today's project already has the html.index and the styles.css premade for you. I know the programming bit can seem a bit scary at first, and because of this I selected a project for your first that comes with a VIDEO WALKTHROUGH  =) (yay cheers yay).


Today's Project aims to show you how javascript is used to connect the CSS and HTML Page and allow you to use them to change things based on what the user does (like clicking a button).

# **~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
# Project:

Add Functionility to the html.index page so when a user presses a button, it plays a sound and animates the button being pressed, Create A Drum Kit.


## Step1 (Approx. time: 10-20min):

Today's project is really simple!

## Step 2 (Approx. time: 5min):

Customize your drum keys. Change the background color, the highlight colors, the background image of the page, keys, and anything else you want to make it more of your style.



## Step 3: Create a branch in our Git Repository to upload your finished work.
I will personally walk you through this step the first time.

How can this project be used in the future?

You've literally just made a drum kit.. THINK! There are a ton of ways what you've done today can help when building a website, for example, a soundboard! Also you've learned how to make things happen when an object is clicked, it doesn't have to be just play a sound!
