# "My Favorite Animal!"

> ~[Okay, you know programming? So what! That don't impress me much, So you got the code but have you got the touch? don't get me wrong, yeah your syntax is all that, but that wont keep me...](https://youtu.be/jQZTK6xJ1Bw?t=15s)~

Programming is only half of web design (which is why I think its awesome for artisty people.), The other half is **DESIGN!** When it comes to Design, CSS is your *style sheet*.

Think of CSS as a **Customizable Wardrobe**, and the website as a doll, with CSS you can style it to look however you want.

Today's Project aims to help you fall in love with, and learn of, the abilities of CSS.
